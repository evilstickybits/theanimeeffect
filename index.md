# Transcript and Links for Anime Mentioned in The Anime Effect Podcast

## Project Inspiration

I’m a fan of The Anime Effect by Crunchyroll; the hosts’ enthusiasm and knowledge make the podcast both fun and informative. Each episode introduces me to new anime, manga, and games. However, due to a few factors—like pronunciation, occasional slurred speech, or simply listening while driving—it’s sometimes hard to catch the exact names of the titles they discuss.

This project is dedicated to solving that. The goal is to create a resource that provides an organized list of anime, games, manga, etc., mentioned in each episode, complete with links to learn more or start watching. Ideally, this will make it easier for other fans to discover and explore the same shows without missing out on recommendations.

## Project Scope

I’m still considering the approach: I may include full episode transcripts or focus on timestamped sections with the titles and links only. [I also welcome contributions from other fans who want to help identify shows or provide accurate links. Heck if you want to take a crack at the newer episodes, please do!](https://github.com/evilstickybits/theanimeeffect).

Thank you for your interest in this project, and I hope it helps you enjoy the world of anime even more!

Thanks
