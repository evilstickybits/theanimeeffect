# theanimeeffect
Transcript and links to anime mentioned in the Podcast.

Inspiration:

I enjoy The Anime Effect by Crunchyroll. The hosts seem like fun people and passionate about anime. The show also introduces me to new animes to watch. 

But, either because I'm driving, the hosts accents when pronouncing Japananese names, over enthusiasm that causes slightly slured speech or language barrier, the names of the anime shows at times are difficult to understand. Or I am driving and dont have time to write down the names of the shows.

I am starting this project with the goal of making it easier for everyone to have a list of the shows, games, manga, etc, and have a link to that content. I also hope that others can also help me understand what animes the hosts are talking about in the podcast, and provide links so others can also enjoy the shows.

I am unsure if I will be using the whole podcast transcript, or perhaps I will only keep the podcast episode sections and then names/links within those sections.

Thanks
