# theanimeeffect
Transcript and links to anime mentioned in the Podcast.

Inspiration:

I enjoy The Anime Effect by Crunchyroll. The hosts seem like fun people and passionate about anime. The show also introduces me to new animes to watch. 

But, either because of the hosts accent, over enthusiasm or language barrier, the pronunciation of the anime shows at times makes it difficult to understand the name of the anime they are talking about. 

I am starting this project with the hope that others can also help me understand what animes the hosts are talking about in the podcast, and provide links so others can also enjoy the shows.

I am unsure if I will be using the whole podcast transcript, or perhaps I will only keep the podcast episode sections and then names/links within those sections.

Thanks
